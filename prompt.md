Analyze the documentation for the adk project and please come up with a list of features that adk delivers. Focus on page titles and section headers to come up with that list.

Once that is done, I'd like to generate a matrix of features enabled by runtime.

Currently there are two runtimes python which is the primary, and java. But soon go and typescript will be added, but typescript will be known as adk-js.

A good metric for figuring out if a feature is supported per runtime is if the sample code associated with a given feature in adk-docs includes samples in a given language. 

For each matrix item showing support, please link to the code sample where you use to say that this feature is supported in the language.  

Output the content in markdown.
